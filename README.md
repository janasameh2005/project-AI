# Problem name:
Knapsack Problem Solver: A Comparative Analysis Using Search and Meta-Heuristic Algorithms.
# Describtion and objective:
This project presents a comparative study on solving the classic 0/1 Knapsack Problem using advanced Artificial Intelligence and Search techniques.
The objective is to efficiently select a subset of items, each with a specific weight and value, to maximize the total value without exceeding the capacity constraint of the knapsack.

# Requirements / Prerequisites
* **Programming-language**:Python 3.14.2
* **Essential-libraries**: 
    * `NumPy`: For handling numerical calculations and generating test problem instances.
    * `Pandas`: For data manipulation and storing comparative results (e.g., solution time vs. solution value).
    * `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn`: For generating comparative performance graphs and visualizations of the algorithms' results.
